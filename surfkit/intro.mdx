`SurfKit` is an orchestartor for building and launching agents locally, in a docker container, 
or in the cloud. Think of it as k8s for agents.

There are several key concepts `SurfKit` operates with:

* **Device** is an entity that implements the `Device` protocol from the `DeviceBay` and allows your agent to use this device 
via user-defined observations and actions. Right now, we support one kind of devices with the UI, which is `Desktop`: 
a VM that can be managed via mouse and keyboard programmatically. It can run locally (via QEMU), in GCP or in AWS. 
Other devices can be used in the agent code as libraries. We plan to implement more types of devices soon.
* **Tracker** is an entity that takes care of assigning and observing the tasks amoung the agents. Trackers are run in Docker or in K8s.
* **Type** is the type of the Agent, for example, SurfPizza, SurfSlicer, or SurfMonsta. The types can be defined either in Hub 
(more on that later), or in the local repository.
* **Agent** is an entity of one of the types. That's the process that is going to solve the tasks for you, that can be executed as
a local process (which is super handy during development), in a Docker container or in K8s.
* **Task** is a unit of an Agent operation that has a description and a device to execute that action against. A task may be as simple as 
"Find me an image of a cool cat on Google" or as complex as looking for accomodation on Airbnb with lots of filters and search aspects. 

`Hub` is a place where you can publish and find the agents. It's in early alpha right now, and we have a lot of deveploment planned for it.

The typical usage of an agent is as follows:

* You pick an agent **type** from Hub or by cloning a repo.
* You create a **device** if the agent needs it.
* You create a task **tracker** (optionally, because it will be created if absent).
* You create an **agent** of a given type.
* You ask it to solve the **task**.
* ...
* Profit!

If you want to give it a try as quickly as possible, go to [Quickstart](../quickstart). On this page, we'll dive a bit deeper. So let's go!

If you could only use agents we've developed, that wouldn't be all that useful. `SurfKit` allows you to create and 
publish your agents in Hub, so that other people can find and re-use them. See [Building Your Agent](../advanced_tutorial) for details.

## CLI basics

You can see the detailed (yet incomplete) list of CLI commands at [CLI Documentation](./cli). To see a complete list of commands do this:

```sh
surfkit --help
```

The goal of this section is to tell you more about the lifecycle of each entity we listed above.

* **Devices**, **Trackers**, and **Agents** are similar: you can `create` any of them, `list` them, 
`get` information about them (except for trackers), read the `logs` for agents and trackers and `view` the devices, 
and `delete` any of them to remove the corresponding entity and free up resources.

```sh
surfkit create agent
surfkit list agents
surfkit get agent -n foo
surfkit delete agent -n foo
```

* **Tasks** are different: you create them via `solve` and you can stop them in UI or by cancelling the process with ctrl+c. You can
`list` them and `get` information about them while they are in progress.

* **Types** are the most unique entities in this list:

  * To create a repository for a new type of agent, you run `new`.
  * Every time you run an agent from the repo, it gets registered in your local database, so you'll see it via `list types`.
  * To build an image for the agent type, you run `build`.
  * When the image is uploaded and the `agent.yaml` is updated, you can `login` into Hub and `publish` this type. Now other users will be able to use it!
