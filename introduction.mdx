## Introduction

AgentSea delivers a collection of libraries and tools for building AI agent based applications. We favor 
the UNIX philosophy of do one thing and do it well. That makes our tools easy to use, easy to extend, and 
easy to mix and match. Use the tools one by one or stack them together into a single agent app.

You can also use our tools with other popular frameworks like LlamaIndex and LangChain.  

Here's a list of our current projects:

* `AgentD`: a powerful daemon that makes a Linux desktop OS accessible to AI agents.
* `ToolFuse`: a library for wrapping up scripts, 3rd party apps and APIs as ``Tool`` implementations for AI agents.
* `AgentDesk`: a library for running ``Agentd`` powered VMs as ``Tool`` instances.
* `ThreadMem`: a library for building multi-role persistent threads.
* `SurfKit`: a toolkit for building GUI surfer agents that can navigate UIs.

All these tools comes together in:

* `SurfDino`: an agent that explores and navigates GUIs.

All our tools are licensed under the MIT License. We're open to contributions. If you have 
any ideas, bug reports, or code contributions, please open an issue or a pull request in the 
right repo.  Let's work together and build better agents now.
