## Introduction

The platform delivers a collection of libraries and tools for building AI agent apps. We favor the UNIX philosophy of do one thing and do it well. That makes our tools easy to use, easy to extend, and easy to mix and match. Use the tools one by one or stack them together into a single agent app.

You can also use our tools with other popular frameworks like LlamaIndex and LangChain.  

Our current projects:

* `AgentD`: a powerful daemon that makes a Linux desktop OS accessible to AI agents.
* `ToolFuse`: a library for wrapping up scripts, 3rd party apps and APIs as ``Tool`` implementations for AI agents.
* `AgentDesk`: a library for running ``Agentd`` powered VMs as ``Tool`` instances.
* `ThreadMem`: a library for building multi-role persistent threads.
* `SurfKit`: a toolkit for building GUI surfer agents that can navigate UIs.

Build your own agent or use all our tools together with your premade alpha agents:

* `SurfPizza`: an agent that explores and navigates GUIs.
* `SurfSlicer`: an agent that explores and navigates GUIs.
* `SurfNinja`: an agent that explores and navigates GUIs.
* `SurfMonsta`: an agent that explores and navigates GUIs.

SurfNinja and SurfMonsta offer the best performance. They use a combo of old school computer vision techniques, mashed up with multimodal models and our tools.

All the tools are free to use and licensed under the MIT License. We love contributions. If you have ideas, bug reports, or code contributions, please open an issue or a pull request in the 
right repo.  

Let's work together and build better agents now.
