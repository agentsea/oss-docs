In this guide, we'll show how to create your own agent using surfkit and some of the techniques we came up along the way. 

## Prerequisites

* Install `poetry` (see [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)).
* Install `surfkit` (see [Quickstart](./quickstart)).
* Set up your local or cloud environment (see [Configuration](./configuration)).
* Install Tesseract on your machine (see [Tesseract docs](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)).

## Creating an Agent

Creating a dummy agent that follows the SurfKit protocol is super easy:

```
mkdir surfhamster
cd surfhamster 
surfkit new
```

The last command will ask you to answer a few questions:

```
Enter agent name: SurfHamster
Describe the agent: The AI agent that can navigate GUIs and do tasks in them.
Enter git user reference (Your Name <your.email@gmail.com>): 
Enter docker image repo: 
Enter icon url (https://tinyurl.com/y5u4u7te): 
```

Feel free to leave the docker image repo empty for now and use a standard icon. When you run these commands, an Agent project will be initialized inside the folder that you created. It contains all components you need to give it a try:

```
surfkit create tracker -n hound001 -r docker 
surfkit create device -n eve001 -p qemu
surfkit create agent -n robby001 -r process

surfkit solve -a robby001 --device eve001 --tracker hound001 -d "Find a cool cat image in the internet" --starting-url "google.com"
```

If the browser tab with a VM desktop and an agent log opens and the agent starts solving the task, congratulations: you have just created your first agent!
