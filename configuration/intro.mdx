Agentsea is designed to run on your local machine or in the cloud.

Agents can run as:

- Python processes
- Docker containers
- Kubernetes pods

Desktops can run on:

- QEMU
- GCE
- EC2

This section will provide an in depth walkthrough on how to set up your cloud to work with Surfkit.

We guide you through both Google Cloud (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) from scratch. 
Both are supported by Surfkit, and Azure will be coming soon.
